# 1. Introduction

- Java is **both compiled and interpreted**.
- Source code is compiled into **machine-independent bytecode**.
- Bytecode is interpreted by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** for the host system.
- This makes Java **platform-independent**.
- In contrast, **C/C++** compiles directly to native machine code and is platform-dependent.

## 2. History of Java

- Java started as a project named **"Oak"** by **James Gosling** at **Sun Microsystems** in **June 1991**.
- Goals:
  - Create a virtual machine and language with familiar **C-like syntax**.
  - Improve **simplicity** and **uniformity** over C/C++.
- **Java 1.0** was released publicly in **1995**.
  - Promoted the slogan: **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"**.
  - Free runtimes were available for major platforms.
  - Integrated into browsers as secure **applets**.
- Versions:
  - **Java 2** introduced **J2SE, J2EE, J2ME** for different platforms.
- Standardization:
  - Java was submitted to **ISO/IEC** and **Ecma**, but later withdrawn.
  - Remains a **proprietary de facto standard**, governed by the **Java Community Process (JCP)**.
- Tools:
  - **SDK** (Software Development Kit): Includes compiler, debugger, etc.
  - **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment): Only runtime environment, no compiler.

## 3. Philosophy of Java

### Primary Design Goals

- Follow **object-oriented programming** principles.
- Allow execution across **multiple operating systems**.
- Provide **built-in networking support**.
- Execute **remote code securely**.
- Maintain **ease of use**, inspired by the best of existing OOP languages.

---

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming in Java

### Core Concepts

- Combines **data (state)** and **behavior (methods)** into **objects**.
- Objects are **self-contained units** that model real-world entities.
- Encourages **modular design** and separation of concerns.

### Benefits

- Simplifies management of **large-scale software**.
- Promotes **code reusability** across projects.
- Enables building systems from **pre-tested components**.

### Challenges

- Designing **generic, reusable** objects is difficult.
- Lacks effective systems for **reuse communication**.
- Open source communities help share reusable **libraries and patterns**.

## 5. Platform Independence

### How Java Achieves It

- Code is compiled into **Java bytecode**, not native machine code.
- Bytecode runs on any platform via the **JVM**.
- JVM implementations exist for many operating systems and hardware types.

### Supporting Tools

- Java provides **standardized APIs** for networking, threading, graphics, etc.
- These APIs offer a **uniform interface** to system-level features.

### Bytecode Execution Methods

- **Interpreter**: Reads and executes bytecode line by line.
- **JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time)**: Converts bytecode to native machine code at runtime.
- **Dynamic Recompilation**: Analyzes runtime behavior for optimization.

### Native Compilation

- Tools like **GCJ** compile Java directly into native binaries.
- Improves speed but **sacrifices portability**.

### Legal and Compatibility Issues

- Java must be **fully compatible** across implementations.
- Sun sued Microsoft for introducing **non-standard features** and omitting APIs like RMI and JNI.
- Result:
  - Java no longer bundled with Windows.
  - Browsers like Internet Explorer require **third-party plugins** for Java support.

### Portability Success and Challenges

- Often parodied: **"Write Once, Debug Everywhere"**.
- Platform inconsistencies exist, but Java excels in:
  - **Server-side development** (e.g., Servlets, EJBs).
  - **Embedded systems** (e.g., OSGi environments).

## 6. Automatic Garbage Collection

### Memory Management in Java

- Java automates memory management via **garbage collection**.
- Developers only control **object creation**.
- JVM automatically deletes objects with **no remaining references**.

### Advantages Over Manual Memory Management

- Prevents **memory leaks** and **double deallocation**.
- Reduces **developer overhead** and **code complexity**.

### Reusability and Performance

- Encourages creation of **temporary objects** (e.g., in multithreading).
- Promotes use of **immutable value-objects**.
- Helps avoid synchronization issues.

### Comparison with C++

- C++ supports custom memory models but requires **manual memory management**.
- Java provides **built-in garbage collection**, invisible to the developer.
- Downsides:
  - Less control over **when** memory is freed.
  - Can introduce **performance unpredictability** in time-sensitive applications.

---

## 7. Java Syntax Overview

- Java syntax is largely inspired by **C++**.
- Key distinctions:
  - Java is almost entirely **object-oriented**.
  - Primitive types (int, float, char, boolean) are **not objects**.
  - All code must be written **inside classes**.
- Unlike C++, Java does not support:
  - Multiple inheritance (uses interfaces instead).
  - Operator overloading.
  - Pointer arithmetic (for safety reasons).

---

## 8. Summary

Java is a modern, platform-independent, object-oriented programming language known for:

- Its **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"** philosophy.
- Rich **standard libraries**.
- Built-in **garbage collection**.
- Strong **security model** for executing remote code.
- Its widespread usage in **enterprise**, **web**, **mobile**, and **embedded** domains.
