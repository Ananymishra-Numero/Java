# Java Applets – Beginner's Guide

---

## What is an Applet?

- A **Java Applet** is a small Java program that runs **inside a web browser**.
- Unlike standalone Java applications, applets are **embedded in HTML pages** and executed by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** within the browser.
- Applets were commonly used for **interactive content** like games, calculators, and visualizations on web pages.

---

## Key Characteristics

- Applets run **inside a browser** (client-side), not on a server.
- Do **not require a `main()` method**; instead, they rely on predefined **lifecycle methods**.
- Use the **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** for GUI elements.
- Can only run in environments that support **Java plug-ins** (most modern browsers have dropped support).

---

## Applet Lifecycle

An applet follows a specific lifecycle managed by the browser or applet viewer. There are **five key methods**:

1. **`init()`**
   - Called once when the applet is first loaded.
   - Used to initialize variables, UI components, etc.

2. **`start()`**
   - Called every time the applet becomes active (e.g., when a user returns to the browser tab).
   - Can be called multiple times.

3. **`paint(Graphics g)`**
   - Called automatically after `start()` to draw graphics on the screen.
   - Uses the **Graphics** class to render shapes, text, etc.

4. **`stop()`**
   - Called when the user navigates away from the page.
   - Use this to pause animations or threads.

5. **`destroy()`**
   - Called when the applet is closed permanently (e.g., browser shutdown).
   - Used to release resources.

## Example: A Simple Applet

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

/*
  <applet code="HelloApplet.class" width="300" height="150">
  </applet>
*/

public class HelloApplet extends Applet {
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString("Hello, Applet World!", 50, 75);
    }
}
````

* The HTML comment block (`<applet>...</applet>`) is used to embed the applet in an HTML page.
* The `paint()` method draws the text at coordinates (50, 75).

---

## Embedding in HTML

Here’s how to embed the compiled `.class` file into a webpage:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <applet code="HelloApplet.class" width="300" height="150">
    </applet>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Save this as `index.html` in the same folder as `HelloApplet.class`.
* Use **`appletviewer`** (part of JDK) to run it:

## Security Restrictions

Due to security concerns, applets operate within a **sandbox environment**:

* Cannot access local files (without explicit permission).
* Cannot connect to servers other than the one they came from.
* Cannot execute native code.

These restrictions protect users from malicious applets but limit functionality.

---

## Why Applets are Obsolete

* As of 2017, **Java Applet support was removed** from major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* Reasons:

  * **Security vulnerabilities**
  * **Performance issues**
  * Rise of **modern web technologies** (JavaScript, HTML5, WebAssembly)
* JavaFX and web-based frameworks have replaced applets for most use cases.

---

## Use Cases (Historical)

Before becoming obsolete, applets were used for:

* Interactive educational tools
* Online games
* Data visualization
* Animation and GUI demos
* Web-based calculators and utilities

| Feature           | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform          | Runs in browsers or `appletviewer`                    |
| Lifecycle Methods | `init()`, `start()`, `paint()`, `stop()`, `destroy()` |
| GUI Support       | AWT-based                                             |
| HTML Embedding    | `<applet>` tag                                        |
| Status            | Deprecated and obsolete                               |
| Replacement       | JavaFX, HTML5, JavaScript                             |

## Final Note

> Applets played a crucial role in bringing interactive content to early web applications. However, due to evolving technology and security models, they are now part of Java's legacy. Learning them is still valuable for historical context and understanding Java’s evolution.
